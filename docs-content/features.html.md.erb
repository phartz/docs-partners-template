This topic describes the service features more in depth.

## On­demand Service Instance Provisioning

* A MongoDB is deployed fully automatically. A single VM MongoDB server or a
multi­MV MongoDB Replica Set can be provisioned by developers with a **single
command**.

## Service Instance Isolation

* Each MongoDB server runs on a **dedicated virtual machine** to ensure "**bad
neighborhood protection**" in order to be aligned with enterprise security
requirements.

* Cloud Foundry **security groups** are used to prevent that a **network
connection** can be established by **unauthorized applications**.


## High Availability

* High availability is ensured through MongoDB **Replica Sets**.

* The **Consul based internal DNS system** delivered by the anynines Consul-DNS
ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node.
